        Hi, my name is Vishal.\nIndeed there is nothing fancy about a name,\nput out so thoughtlessly.\nSo what do I tell you,\nI love reading books and I love them because unlike people they stay, like an experience they season,\ngrow old and stay with me when I need them to.
        \n\nThere is nothing wrong with people except for their uncertainity!
        \nThe biggest issue with most people is the fact that we get attached and we do get attached pretty bad.\nIs it our genetic makeup or instinct I do not know.
        \nI guess it hurts but so did leaving the womb,losing your favorite toy, get scolded the first day and every other thing that you can think about.
        \nLearn to make peace!
        \n\n\nEvery person is as sad and as sulky.
